brew-gem -- install gems as homebrew formulas
=============================================

`brew gem` allows you to install any rubygem as a homebrew formula.

It works by generating a stub formula for homebrew, which looks something like this:

    class Ronn < Formula
      def initialize(*args)
        @name = "ronn"
        @version = "0.7.3"
        super
      end

      def install
        system "gem", "install", name, "--version", version, "--install-dir", prefix
      end
    end

This formula installs and unpacks all the dependencies under the Cellar path. So the package is completely self contained.


Dependencies
------------
This requires a system rubygems version of 2.3 or greater
There is a bug prior to 2.3 that doesn't install the full dependency tree properly when you use the install-dir flag.

```
sudo /usr/bin/gem update --system
```


Install
-------

    brew install brew-gem


Usage
-----

    brew gem install heroku

To install a specific version:

    brew gem install heroku 3.8.3
    
To upgrade:

    brew gem upgrade heroku
    
To uninstall:

    brew gem uninstall heroku


### BASH/ZSH Completions

To make use of completions for your gem, you need to install the
`bash-completion` formula:

    brew install bash-completion

And then install a gem with the completion files in the following locations:

* A directory named either `completion` or `completions` with the file being
  the name of the gem appended with the completion type.

  For example:  `completions/tmuxinator.bash`
* A file somewhere in your repo named `<your_gem_name>_completion.zsh`.

Files with `.bash` and `.sh` will be associated with bash and files ending in
`.zsh` will be associated with zsh.


Philosophy
----------

This is **not** for installing development libraries, but for standalone binary tools that you want system wide.


Troubleshooting
----------

If your seeing build errors similar to this:
```shell
==> Fetching opsicle from gem source
==> gem install /Library/Caches/Homebrew/opsicle-0.4.2.gem --no-rdoc --no-ri --no-user-install --install-dir /usr/local/Cellar/opsicle/0.4.2 --bindir /usr/local/Cellar/opsicle/0.4.2/bin
make: *** [generator.bundle] Error 1

```

You probably have xcode 5.1 installed which changed the way the compilers handle flags.

You'll need to set `ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future` before installing.
_You may want to add this to your profile so you don't have to set it each time._
